JSHManager ChangeLog

Version 0.2.4
-------------
- Fixed error when trying to download song data after a song's name
  had been changed on ScoreHero.
- Added Rock Band 2 for PS3.
- Added AC/DC Live Track Pack tier for Rock Band games.
- Added additional forum links.

Version 0.2.3
-------------
- Some text has been converted to be more "friendly."
- The splash screen is no longer always-on-top.
- Added a context menu when you right-click on a song in the scores
  table. It has items to bring you to the song's rankings, wiki, and
  SP wiki pages as well as a menu for any links from the SP wiki page,
  which are usually links to SP path images.
- Added wiki menu for quick wiki access.
- Added an update checker. A download link will be displayed in the 
  status bar if a newer version is available (you must still install
  the update manually however).
- Added CTRL+ALT+U shortcut to open the Score Upload Wizard.

Version 0.2.2
-------------
- Corrected a bug that prevented you from logging in if you did not
  enter your username /exactly/ as it appeared on ScoreHero.
- Clicking a blue, underlined score (or the open button next to the image
  URL in the editor) will now open an internal picture viewer instead of 
  launching an external browser, if possible.
- Added better detection for determining if a score submission was successful. 
  Scores can be resubmitted if it is not certain they were submitted initially.
  These scores will be highlighted red instead of blue to indicate their
  status.
- Added "Go to Song" item to the main "Scores" menu and the score editor.

Version 0.2.1
-------------
- Added extra logging and improved error checking when logging in to
  ScoreHero.
- Added a new menu item to upload logs to pastebin.com in the
  Help -> View Log menu. After uploading, you can copy and paste the
  URLs when reporting an issue so that I can see the logging information.
- Added a new step to the score download wizard that allows you to download
  scores for multiple platforms/difficulties/instruments in one shot.
- Fixed bug when trying to download RB scores where a rating wasn't specified.
- Added a CSV score importer accessible from the "Scores" menu. See
  Readme.txt for more details.

Version 0.2.0
-------------
- Rock Band 1 and 2 are now supported. While it only took 35 characters
  to express that, I assure you, it took a significant effort to
  actually make it happen ;)
- Corrected issue when updating Guitar Hero song data that failed to
  update an existing song if new information had been discovered, such
  as a note count.
- When using the score editor panel to create and save a new score,
  the entire tree of scores is no longer reloaded.
- You can now more quickly enter a score via the score editor by
  clicking "Add score via editor" from the "Scores" menu or by pressing
  CTRL+N. This has the effect of toggling the editor if it is hidden
  and then pressing the "New" button in the editor.

Version 0.1.0
-------------
- Additional logging information is stored in data/logs.
- Corrected calculated rating rounding to be consistent with ScoreHero.
- Quick access to the Readme, ChangeLog, License, and logs has been added
  to the Help menu.
- Picture and video links are now saved when scores are downloaded.
- New scores can now be uploaded individually by first selecting the score
  and clicking "Upload Selected Score" in the "My Scores" menu or by
  pressing CTRL+U.
- The way passwords are stored has been changed to fix potential issues on
  some systems. If you previously saved your password, you will be required
  to re-save your password the next time you need to log in to ScoreHero.
- A new editor has been added that allows an image/video URL to be specified.
  This can be shown/hidden by clicking "Toggle Editor" in the "My Scores" menu
  or by pressing CTRL+E. When the editor is displayed, you can add a new score
  by clicking the "New" button on the editor panel. You can specify the song
  via the auto-completing text field without having to navigate to the song
  in the tree view of the scores.
- Scores with image/video URLs are now distinguished by blue, underlined
  text and/or a camera icon. Clicking on the score will launch an external browser
  to the video URL, if present, or the image URL (clicking on a new score will
  NOT launch a browser so that you can still quickly edit the score).
- Fixed an error that sometimes caused a NonUniqueResultException to occur while
  trying to download scores from ScoreHero.
- The login dialog has been changed in order to fix an issue that caused JSHManager
  to hang after logging in to ScoreHero on Linux systems.
- Added new menus similar to rckr's YUI menus (thanks) to quickly open ScoreHero
  in your browser.
- Any score can now be deleted (not just new, unsubmitted scores) from the
  local database (you can not yet delete scores from ScoreHero's website
  via JSHManager). A confirmation dialog will appear when deleting scores
  that have already been submitted.

Version 0.0.3
-------------
- Selected rows can now be expanded/collapsed via the right/left arrow keys
- Table cells for new scores can be edited simply by beginning to type if
  the cell is selected (has a dashed border around it). You can change the
  selected cell with the arrow keys. Note there is still an issue when
  editing the Comment cell causing text to be appended instead of replaced.
- Hit percentages are now orange between 80 and 99% and red when < 80%
  (same as on ScoreHero)
- Song data is now downloaded automatically the first time you try to
  download scores for a particular game/difficulty. This means it is no
  longer required to manually download song data unless new DLC comes out.

Version 0.0.2
-------------
- Fixed downloading scores for GH1/80s/OT (games that are only on one system)
- Scores are now sorted descending by points

Version 0.0.1
-------------
- Initial release
