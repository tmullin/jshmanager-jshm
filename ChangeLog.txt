JSHManager ChangeLog

Version 0.3.3
-------------
- Added some additional error checking to handle tier errors on ScoreHero
  (namely RB2 expert drums on Wii).
- Added GHVH support.
- Added Green Day: Rock Band support.
- Added Rock Band Network support.
- Fixed issue that was preventing updating of Rock Band song data due to
  new DLC that didn't have a guitar part.

Version 0.3.2
-------------
- Scores for demo tiers are now correctly ignored.
- Empty tiers in the upload score wizard are no longer shown.
- The self-extracting exe for Windows now includes a launcher program,
  JSHManager.exe, that checks that the correct version of Java is installed
  as well as allocates more memory to prevent OutOfMemoryErrors when loading
  chart images. It is recommended, but not required, to use the launcher.
  The patcher program will still update JSHManager.jar correctly.
- Added GH5 support. Also added GHWT PC for completeness.
- Added The Beatles: Rock Band support.
- Fixed bug that sometimes set star rating to blank when quick-editing a
  score via the song list and later editing/saving it via the editor.
- Changed Go To Song behavior from a dialog box to a small bar like
  Internet Explorer or Firefox use for notifications.
- Tiers are now updated with the song data so I won't need to make a new
  release just for tier changes. Tiers are not updated for GH1 through GHA
  since it is unlikely they will ever change.

Version 0.3.1
-------------
- Added a right click menu item to fetch user-submitted SP paths from
  the wiki.
- Clickable links/buttons that might open the internal image viewer can be
  forced to be opened in the browser instead by holding Control (Command on
  Macs) when clicking the link/button. OutOfMemoryErrors occur when trying to
  load large images. If this happens the link will automatically open in the
  browser.
- Added GHA for PC for completeness.
- Added additional sorting options (artist, genre, decade) for Guitar Hero
  games. This data is gathered from the ScoreHero Wiki page for that song.
  If data is missing, you can update the song's wiki page to correct it.
- The checkbox to remember your password is now correctly checked if it was
  previously stored and unchecking the box will remove the stored password.
- Fixed issue with songs/scores not showing up after the first tier for
  WT Drums.

Version 0.3.0
-------------
- GHWT, GHM, and GHSH are at long last supported.
- May possibly have fixed NullPointerException related to
  jshm.Score.equals(Score.java:590). Hard to test this though.
- The last game/instrument/difficulty you viewed is now saved and
  restored when you restart the program.
- Menu items that used Control for the accelerator keystroke should now
  use Command on Macs (though I can't really test this).
- Added more options to the right-click menu when browsing scores.
- Fixed bug that made the go to song feature stop working after opening
  the score upload wizard.
- Added a toolbar for quicker access to some of the menu commands.
- Added more song sorting options. Guitar Hero games can only be sorted
  by ScoreHero's sorting and title due to no apparant song data feed.
  Rock Band has the same in-game sorting options thanks to pksage's
  master song list. There are some discrepencies between his list
  and ScoreHero however. Those songs will show up in an <UNKNOWN> tier.
  The sorting can be selected from File -> Sort Songs by.
- There is now an option to hide songs and tiers that don't have any
  scores. You can still insert a score via the editor for a hidden song,
  which will cause it to appear in the list. This can be toggled in the
  File menu.
- Songs now have an icon to indicate where they are from (i.e. RB1, RB2,
  DLC, AC/DC).
- Corrected Classic Rock Track Pack tier to show up under RB1 for PS2.

Version 0.2.8
-------------
- Added more performance improvements. The "Downloaded Songs" tier in
  Rock Band shouldn't take as much time to load now though it will still
  be slower depending on how many different songs you have scores for
  (this won't affect you unless you have scores for the majority of the
  songs in the DLC tier).

Version 0.2.7
-------------
- Added some performance improvements, it shouldn't take as long between
  clicking a game/instrument/difficulty menu item and the data appearing.
  The "Downloaded Songs" tier in Rock Band takes a noticable amount
  of time to expand due to the large number of songs in that tier. This
  is a known issue.
- Added a new update mechanism for Rock Band song data that should make
  updating the song data a little faster.
- Added Classic Rock Track Pack tier for RB2 on PS2.
- Added confirmation dialog if you have un-uploaded scores when you try
  to exit the program or switch games/instruments/difficulties.

Version 0.2.6
-------------
- Added Rock Band 2 for PS2 and Wii (finally).

Version 0.2.5
-------------
- Added Track Pack Volume 2 tier for PS2 and Wii and AC/DC Live Track Pack
  tier for Wii.

Version 0.2.4
-------------
- Fixed error when trying to download song data after a song's name
  had been changed on ScoreHero.
- Added Rock Band 2 for PS3.
- Added AC/DC Live Track Pack tier for Rock Band games.
- Added additional forum links.

Version 0.2.3
-------------
- Some text has been converted to be more "friendly."
- The splash screen is no longer always-on-top.
- Added a context menu when you right-click on a song in the scores
  table. It has items to bring you to the song's rankings, wiki, and
  SP wiki pages as well as a menu for any links from the SP wiki page,
  which are usually links to SP path images.
- Added wiki menu for quick wiki access.
- Added an update checker. A download link will be displayed in the 
  status bar if a newer version is available (you must still install
  the update manually however).
- Added CTRL+ALT+U shortcut to open the Score Upload Wizard.

Version 0.2.2
-------------
- Corrected a bug that prevented you from logging in if you did not
  enter your username /exactly/ as it appeared on ScoreHero.
- Clicking a blue, underlined score (or the open button next to the image
  URL in the editor) will now open an internal picture viewer instead of 
  launching an external browser, if possible.
- Added better detection for determining if a score submission was successful. 
  Scores can be resubmitted if it is not certain they were submitted initially.
  These scores will be highlighted red instead of blue to indicate their
  status.
- Added "Go to Song" item to the main "Scores" menu and the score editor.

Version 0.2.1
-------------
- Added extra logging and improved error checking when logging in to
  ScoreHero.
- Added a new menu item to upload logs to pastebin.com in the
  Help -> View Log menu. After uploading, you can copy and paste the
  URLs when reporting an issue so that I can see the logging information.
- Added a new step to the score download wizard that allows you to download
  scores for multiple platforms/difficulties/instruments in one shot.
- Fixed bug when trying to download RB scores where a rating wasn't specified.
- Added a CSV score importer accessible from the "Scores" menu. See
  Readme.txt for more details.

Version 0.2.0
-------------
- Rock Band 1 and 2 are now supported. While it only took 35 characters
  to express that, I assure you, it took a significant effort to
  actually make it happen ;)
- Corrected issue when updating Guitar Hero song data that failed to
  update an existing song if new information had been discovered, such
  as a note count.
- When using the score editor panel to create and save a new score,
  the entire tree of scores is no longer reloaded.
- You can now more quickly enter a score via the score editor by
  clicking "Add score via editor" from the "Scores" menu or by pressing
  CTRL+N. This has the effect of toggling the editor if it is hidden
  and then pressing the "New" button in the editor.

Version 0.1.0
-------------
- Additional logging information is stored in data/logs.
- Corrected calculated rating rounding to be consistent with ScoreHero.
- Quick access to the Readme, ChangeLog, License, and logs has been added
  to the Help menu.
- Picture and video links are now saved when scores are downloaded.
- New scores can now be uploaded individually by first selecting the score
  and clicking "Upload Selected Score" in the "My Scores" menu or by
  pressing CTRL+U.
- The way passwords are stored has been changed to fix potential issues on
  some systems. If you previously saved your password, you will be required
  to re-save your password the next time you need to log in to ScoreHero.
- A new editor has been added that allows an image/video URL to be specified.
  This can be shown/hidden by clicking "Toggle Editor" in the "My Scores" menu
  or by pressing CTRL+E. When the editor is displayed, you can add a new score
  by clicking the "New" button on the editor panel. You can specify the song
  via the auto-completing text field without having to navigate to the song
  in the tree view of the scores.
- Scores with image/video URLs are now distinguished by blue, underlined
  text and/or a camera icon. Clicking on the score will launch an external browser
  to the video URL, if present, or the image URL (clicking on a new score will
  NOT launch a browser so that you can still quickly edit the score).
- Fixed an error that sometimes caused a NonUniqueResultException to occur while
  trying to download scores from ScoreHero.
- The login dialog has been changed in order to fix an issue that caused JSHManager
  to hang after logging in to ScoreHero on Linux systems.
- Added new menus similar to rckr's YUI menus (thanks) to quickly open ScoreHero
  in your browser.
- Any score can now be deleted (not just new, unsubmitted scores) from the
  local database (you can not yet delete scores from ScoreHero's website
  via JSHManager). A confirmation dialog will appear when deleting scores
  that have already been submitted.

Version 0.0.3
-------------
- Selected rows can now be expanded/collapsed via the right/left arrow keys
- Table cells for new scores can be edited simply by beginning to type if
  the cell is selected (has a dashed border around it). You can change the
  selected cell with the arrow keys. Note there is still an issue when
  editing the Comment cell causing text to be appended instead of replaced.
- Hit percentages are now orange between 80 and 99% and red when < 80%
  (same as on ScoreHero)
- Song data is now downloaded automatically the first time you try to
  download scores for a particular game/difficulty. This means it is no
  longer required to manually download song data unless new DLC comes out.

Version 0.0.2
-------------
- Fixed downloading scores for GH1/80s/OT (games that are only on one system)
- Scores are now sorted descending by points

Version 0.0.1
-------------
- Initial release
