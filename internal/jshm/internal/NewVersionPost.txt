This release has some much needed speed improvements.
The time it takes between selecting a game/difficulty and the data showing up has been reduced.
The problem was actually relating to the GUI, not the database. The Downloaded Songs tier in Rock Band games still takes a small amount of time to open due the the very large number of items.

Also, I've changed the way song data is downloaded for Rock Band. Basically I now maintain an XML file of the song data on SourceForge that JSHManager will attempt to download first. It will fall back to the old, slow way if the XML way fails.
I've set it up to update the XML file once a day. It's still hardly instaneous, but it's definately an improvement.
