I've taken a bit of a break from GH/RB lately but Green Day: Rock Band may have brought me back a bit.

I actually added GHVH back when it came out but never published it due to apparant lack of interest.

I've added RBN support but have not done extensive testing so hopefully it works.

I found that the Rock Band song data hadn't been getting updated since April some time. This was due to a DLC song that didn't have a guitar part, a situation I never planned for. I've corrected that error for now hopefully. 

Hopefully this new release will get some more people interested in my program. Haven't been too many posts in these threads.
