This is a very small update (really just one line of code) that greatly
helps the load time for the "Downloaded Songs" tier in Rock Band. The time
it takes to load shouldn't be nearly as long. In my case it's the difference
between 3 seconds and almost not noticeable. The issue is now the number
of songs that you have scores for in the DLC tier. Previously it was the
total number of songs in the DLC tier regardless of whether you had a score
or not. That is, it might take 3 seconds to load if you have scores for
every single DLC song but since most people don't it's not too big of 
an issue.

I'm going to be working on more sorting options for a future release to
make it more like the in-game sorting options.
