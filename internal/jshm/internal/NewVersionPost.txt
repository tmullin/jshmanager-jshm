Bump for $version

GH5 and TBRB support are obvious features. I also made it so that it can update the tiers automatically when it updates the song data so I won't have to make a release just for tier name changes (except for GH1-GHA but they don't ever change).

The other noteable feature is I've added a launcher, JSHManager.exe, if you download the self-extracing archive for Windows. This just helps to check that Java is installed and also increases the memory limit.

I hope there is still interest in my program after all this time.
