JSHManager - A Java-based program to manage your ScoreHero account.

Current version: [b]0.2.2[/b]
Download: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=240590

Please refer to the Readme.txt for installation and usage instructions. I tried to make that pretty clear and would rather not have to duplicate it here any time I make a change.

[b]In a nutshell:[/b]
The idea is that you enter your scores into JSHManager and then upload them to ScoreHero from within the program.

Guitar Hero and Rock Band games are supported but you can only enter single-player scores.

If you have issues, please report them here so I can fix them.

Please read the Readme.txt carefully. If you ask a question I have answered there I will likely ignore it. However, if you feel I have not adequately explained something in the Readme, please say so. I do my best but I am a rather technical person.
